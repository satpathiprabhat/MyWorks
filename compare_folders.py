compare_folders_missing_only.py

Purpose:
  For each source file (in folder A or folder B depending on MODE), compare it against
  every file in the target folder and write ONLY the lines that are present in the
  source but missing in the target. Empty lines are ignored.

How to use:
  1) Edit the three variables in the "COPY YOUR PATHS / MODE HERE" section:
       - folderA, folderB, output_dir
       - MODE: 'A_to_B', 'B_to_A', or 'BOTH'
  2) Run:
       python compare_folders_missing_only.py

Notes on behavior:
  - For each source file (e.g., a1.txt), the script writes a file:
        a1.txt.vs_all_from_<target_folder>.missing.txt
    which contains, per target file, only the missing lines (with original line numbers).
  - If a source line appears multiple times and it is missing in the target, every occurrence
    is reported with its original line number.
  - Threading is used per-source-file; each thread writes to its own dedicated output file
    so there are no race conditions.
